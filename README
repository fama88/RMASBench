Step for testing:
1. Go into the RSLB2/boot directory
2. Execute the java -jar start.jar command
3. Set your chosen parameters and specific algorithm variables (defaults can be set in the gui_defaults.cfg)
4. Press start simulation (if you press the stop button the simulation terminates and it will start again from the beginning if the start button is pressed)
5. At the end of each simulation the result can be found in the RSLB2/boot/result/test folder
6. The results are plotted into graphics with the plot.sh script found in the RSLB2/boot/results folder (if you want different graphics you can modify the plot.sh script).
