Interface -- TO DO LIST

1. Move the DecentralizedAssignmentSimulator numberofiteration and N (utilityM) to the configfile. //DONE
2. Create a general config file specifying also the number of times you want the algorithm to run.
3. Create a new script to make the simulation run for a number of times specified in the config file and generate graphics
4. Re-implement the ComSimulator in a more general way.
5. Remove the Params.DSA_CHANGE_VALUE_PROBABILITY from the assignmentInterface (?)
6. Create the plot script
